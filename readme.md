# Lab 1

## File structure

bnfc contains some sort of hack not ment to be used as a self-contained program.
It can't read symlinks so grammar files needs to be placed in the same folder
as all kinds of random generated files.

Important files in ./bnfc:

* CPP.cf - grammar file
* test.sh - runs test suite

## Run

cd bnfc
./test.sh
